# recommended-system
Project Overview:
The project is a basic movie recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. Collaborative filtering is a common approach for building recommendation systems, where users' preferences and behaviors are used to make movie recommendations. In this example, we use Python and the Surprise library to create the recommendation system.

Key Components and Steps:
Sample Movie Ratings Dataset:

We start with a simple sample dataset that represents movie ratings by users. The dataset contains the following columns: 'user_id', 'item_id' (movie ID), and 'rating' (rating given by the user).
Data Preprocessing:

We use the pandas library to load the sample dataset into a DataFrame.
We define a Reader object in Surprise to specify the rating scale (in this case, ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5).
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into a training set and a test set to evaluate the recommendation model's performance. In this example, we use an 80-20 split ratio.
Model Building and Training:

We build a collaborative filtering model using the SVD algorithm provided by the Surprise library.
The model is trained on the training set using the .fit() method.
Model Evaluation:

We evaluate the model's performance on the test set using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Lower RMSE values indicate better prediction accuracy.
Making Movie Recommendations:

We select a specific user (e.g., 'User1') and identify the movies they have already rated.
We create a list of movies that the user has not rated (unrated movies).
For each unrated movie, we predict the user's rating using the trained model.
The predictions are sorted in descending order of estimated rating.
The top N movies with the highest estimated ratings are recommended to the user.
Display Recommendations:
The code displays the top recommended movies along with their movie IDs and estimated ratings for the selected user.
Output:
The output of the project includes two main parts:

RMSE Value: The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value, which quantifies the prediction accuracy of the collaborative filtering model on the test set.

Top Recommended Movies: The top N movies recommended to the selected user based on their predicted ratings. The movie IDs and estimated ratings for each recommendation are displayed.

Potential Enhancements:
In a real-world scenario, you would use a much larger and more diverse dataset.
You could improve the recommendation system by incorporating user demographics, item attributes, and other features.
Implementing user interfaces or web applications to provide a user-friendly recommendation system.
Remember that this is a simplified example meant for educational purposes. Real-world recommendation systems are often more complex and require extensive data preprocessing, model tuning, and scalability considerations.
